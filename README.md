# Thesis
Here is a copy of my QMSS Thesis

The .Rmd file should knit properly to an html output. 
The .docx output will mostly work, but require some editting and manually adding in the stargazer table.
There are still issues with knitting ot a .pdf file.

The coefficient tables made with stargazer will be exported as separate .html files regardless of the output type.
These are meant to be copied into the .docx file if needed.
